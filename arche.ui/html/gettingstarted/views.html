<div class="header"><a name="sortview"></a>Sorting columns in an ArchE View</div>
<div class="text">
All of the columns in all the ArchE Views can be sorted. Click on the column that you want the view to be sorted on and the view alternates between an ascending and descending order of sorting for the selected column.
There are some specific details about the sorting of each of the views that are important to mention in this section:
<ul>
<li> In the Design Elements View the values of parameters are sorted as strings irrespective of their datatype in the Core.
<li> In the Design Relations View the values of parameters are sorted as strings irrespective of their datatype in the Core.
<li> In the Functions View the values of the Function Ids are sorted as strings.
<li> In the Jess Console there is no sorting functionality.
<li> In the Model Elements View the values of parameters are sorted as strings irrespective of their datatype in the Core.
<li> In the Model Relations View the values of parameters are sorted as strings irrespective of their datatype in the Core.
<li> In the Scenarios View the (second) column represents the scenario status ("NotAnalyzed", "Satisfied" and "NotSatisfied"). The sorting (based on this column) represents this order of status.
</ul>

<div class="header"><a name="filterview"></a>Dynamic filter in an ArchE View</div>
<div class="text">
At the top of each view (except for the Jess Console), there is a search text box which is a dynamic filter on the view. The user can input text and search on some of the columns of the view. The search criteria is the label for each dynamic filter text box.
